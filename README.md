This simple program allows you to type in a word and the program will convert it to Ascii form. Its still not able to print whole sentances but i'm planning to work on that in the future. Some letters still havent been implemented either. They will eventually all be added.

This program was fully written in C++

# STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!
